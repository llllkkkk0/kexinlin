I am a PhD candidate at the Business School at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). I hold a Master's degree in Management Science and Engineering from the University of Science. My research interests include sustainability and big data analytics, with work published in journals such as Computers & Industrial Engineering and the Journal of Cleaner Production. My current research focuses on developing big data performance evaluation and benchmarking tools for blockchain technology and its applications.
