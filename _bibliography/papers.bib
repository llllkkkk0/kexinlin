  abstract={The digital economy (DEY) has emerged as a critical tool for promoting sustainable urban development through digital transformation. This study examines the effect of DEY on urban energy efficiency in China, employing data from 279 cities between 2011 and 2019. The estimation results reveal a U-shaped relationship between DEY and urban energy efficiency. Specifically, in its initial development stage, DEY reduces energy efficiency, but as it matures, DEY ultimately leads to an improvement in energy efficiency. Moreover, the dynamic threshold model indicates that the U-shaped effects of DEY on energy efficiency depend on industrial structure upgrading, greening urban areas, and the financial support of governments. The results of the Spatial Durbin model confirm that DEY has a spatial spillover effect on urban energy efficiency. Finally, the results of the panel vector autoregression model illustrate a long-term bidirectional causality between DEY and urban energy efficiency.},

  abstract={In the pursuit of carbon neutrality goals, the manufacturing industry is compelled to adopt smart manufacturing practices to comply with environmental regulations. Smart manufacturing, characterized by the integration of Industry 4.0 technologies, offers the potential to reduce energy consumption, emissions, and enhance productivity. This study investigates the influence of the low-carbon city pilot (LCP) policy on smart manufacturing and its underlying mechanisms. Leveraging data spanning 2003 to 2020 from China's A-share-listed manufacturing companies, several key findings emerge. First, the LCP policy exerts a significant positive impact on the smart manufacturing capabilities of companies operating within LCPs, and this impact strengthens over time. Second, a company's innovation and effective resource allocation act as active mediators in the correlation between the LCP policy and smart manufacturing, whereas government intervention plays a positive moderating role. Lastly, state-owned manufacturing companies exhibit a lesser positive effect from the LCP policy compared with their non-state-owned counterparts.},

  abstract={Smart city construction (SCC) has emerged as an innovative approach to address the challenges of urbanization by reconciling economic development and energy utilization. This study employs the difference-in-differences method using data from 284 Chinese cities from 2005 to 2019 to investigate the impact of SCC on energy efficiency and the mediating role of technological innovation. This empirical analysis yields valuable conclusions. First, the SCC in China has significantly improved urban energy efficiency. Second, the driving effect of SCC on energy efficiency gradually increases over time and produces clustered shaded areas. Third, SCC improves urban energy efficiency through green, configuration, and infrastructure effects derived from technological innovation. Finally, SCC has a positive impact on moderately sized cities enriched with human, material, and financial capital.},
